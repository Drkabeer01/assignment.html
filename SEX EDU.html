        Sex education helps people gain the information and skills they need to make the best decisions for themselves about sex and relationships. Planned Parenthood is the nation’s largest provider of sex education, reaching 1.2 million people a year through education and outreach.
        
        Facts About Sex Education
        Sex education is high quality teaching and learning about a broad variety of topics related to sex and sexuality. It explores values and beliefs about those topics and helps people gain the skills that are needed to navigate relationships with self, partners, and community, and manage one’s own sexual health. Sex education may take place in schools, at home, in community settings, or online. 
        
        Planned Parenthood believes that parents play a critical and central role in providing sex education. Here are sex education resources for parents.  
        
        Comprehensive sex education refers to K-12 programs that cover a broad range of topics related to:

        Relationships, including self, family, friendships, romantic relationships, and health care providers
